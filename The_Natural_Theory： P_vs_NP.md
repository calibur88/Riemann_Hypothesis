The Natural Theory: P vs NP

0. The Fitting Symbol

Before reading, take a moment to look at this symbol:

≟(fit)

It is not a mathematical invention. Merely a reminder—a reminder that the equals sign is not empty. Beneath it lies a note:

The above defines the category; the following describes the condition.

Without this note, the question hangs in mid-air. With it, you know where you stand, and which measure you hold.

Now, begin.

1. The Forest

The world never promises to be understood. It simply exists—like a forest.

You stand at the starting point. Two paths diverge before you. A god sits atop the trees, seeing through the mist at a glance, knowing which path leads to fruit and which to a cliff. You stand at the fork, and can only choose one to walk into—choose wrong, and you fall bleeding; choose right, and you were merely “lucky.”

This is the原始 face of P ≟(fit) NP, older than Turing machines, older than polynomials, older than humanity itself.

2. The Sigh

Even an ape, standing before a fork in the path, would let out a sigh.

Translated, that sigh means: “If only I had known beforehand.”

Verification is always easy: the path you have walked, you can回头 tell others “there’s a pit here,” and they understand instantly. Solving is the hard part: standing at the start, you cannot know the end unless you walk it yourself.

This chasm is not a mathematical accident, but an existential necessity. If solving were never hard, time would cease to be a river, causality would collapse, experience would lose its weight, and we would never lie awake at night sighing over “what if I had chosen the other path.”

3. The Prison of Symbols

Mathematicians stole the sigh and stuffed it into symbols.

They built two cages: one called P, one called NP. P is the pair of eyes that can see through the mist; NP is the forest waiting to be walked. Then they asked: are these two cages, in fact, the same?

They forgot to paste the note beneath the equals sign. They thought that as long as the symbols were arranged correctly, the question would stand.

But that equals sign was empty. P ≟ NP lacks not an answer, but a condition.

4. The Hollow Equals Sign and the Fitting Symbol

Are humans and beasts equal? You must first tell me: which ruler are you using—DNA sequence? Intelligence? Moral standing? Or who is better at finding fruit in the forest? Different rulers, different answers.

The same goes for P and NP.

P ≟(reduction) NP — this is the original contract, with the reduction conditions printed in small font on the last page, unseen by most until after they sign.

P ≟(human mind) NP — this is another contract: can the human mind instantly solve what it can instantly verify? The answer is visible to the naked eye: no. Otherwise, you would deduce the Pythagorean theorem yourself the first time you saw it, without waiting for Pythagoras.

P ≟(nature) NP — this is a third: does nature make solving as easy as verifying? Evolution says: an easily verifiable trap, you remember after stepping in once; but next time, it’s a new trap, and you step in again. Solving is always harder than verifying—otherwise, species would not die, experience would not accumulate, and wisdom would not be born.

With the fitting symbol added, one P vs NP splits into countless P vs NPs. Each question has its own answer, each answer its own rationale.

And then you realize: those fitting conditions themselves require new fitting conditions to define. Symbols can never be fully appended, conditions can never be exhaustively written.

But that is precisely the point: Questions are not天然; they are agreed upon. Once the agreement is made clear, the question stands.

5. Recursive Self-Reference

This is the modern version of Hilbert pulling down his pants to fart: input zero, generate self-adjoint features, output zero.

We input P and NP, define polynomial time, define reduction, define nondeterminism, and then ask if they are equal. Round and round, the answer lies hidden in the definitions, the definitions in the assumptions, the assumptions in intuition. What we end up with is nothing but what we brought in at the start.

Today it’s called “polynomial reduction,” tomorrow “completeness problems.” Peel off the shell, and inside is still that old turtle: Verification easy, solving hard—so it has always been, through the ages.

But mathematicians cannot say this directly; it sounds too much like human speech. They have to stuff it into symbols, wax it, polish it, and place it on the display stand of the Millennium Prize, pretending that the equals sign was never empty.

---

6. The Torn Pants

Hilbert wanted to dress mathematics in a pair of pants that would never tear—formal systems, completeness, consistency, the decision problem. He thought that as long as the stitching was dense enough, all truth could be held inside.

Then Gödel came and gave a gentle tug—the pants tore: if this system cannot even hold itself together, how can it hold the world?

P vs NP is the sequel to this play. The pants tear, so you patch them. Patch upon patch, layer upon layer, until finally you point at the pile of patches and say: look, a perfectly intact pair of pants.

But when the wind blows, there is still that hole.

What is that hole called? The sigh before the forest. The equals sign with no conditions written.

7. Nature’s Reply

Heaven and Earth are not humane; to them, all things are straw dogs.

Nature merely lets the forest be there, lets the paths diverge, lets humans choose. How you choose, how you解释 your choice afterward—that is your affair. It does not care whether you can prove P ≟(?) NP, just as it does not care whether you can see the end from the start.

It does not even care what note you paste beneath the equals sign. The note is yours to paste, the question yours to ask, the answer—if you insist on one—yours to walk out yourself.

That chasm is the rope around the straw dog’s neck—you mistake it for a shackle, but it is actually the mark that reminds you: you are not a god.

8. Three Kinds of People

Some insist on proving that the sigh can be eliminated. They plunge into the labyrinth of symbols, left fist fighting right,撞得头破血流. Those who emerge carry “treasures”—more精致的 symbols, telling you how to撞 fewer walls in the labyrinth. Those who do not emerge stay inside, still撞ing.

Some accept the sigh, then choose a path and walk into it. They seek not to solve, but to walk. They seek not to see through the mist, but to plant each step firmly. They know that experience is called experience precisely because it is not foreknowledge.

Some stand outside, watching these two groups, finding both quite interesting. They neither seek to solve nor to walk—they merely watch: watching the forest, watching the diverging paths, watching the people coming and going, watching the fitting symbol that can never be fully appended.

---

9. Walk In

This is Nature’s theory:

Verification easy, solving hard—so it has always been, through the ages. If you insist on asking why, better to ask yourself why you insist on asking why. If you insist on pasting notes beneath the equals sign, better to ask yourself which ruler you truly want to use.

P ≟(fit) NP is not a knot waiting to be untied, but a foundation stone on which we stand. Standing on it, you see the mist, see the diverging paths, see the limits of your own vision—and then you choose a path and walk in.

Walking in is harder than solving it.

Symbols are the map, not the road.
A map can bear ten thousand footnotes; the road is only one.

10. The Final Laugh

Someone asks: “So, does P equal NP or not?”

Go ask the forest. It will let the paths continue to diverge, let you continue to choose, continue to err, continue to learn through pain.

Then, after you have chosen wrong a hundred times, it will present you with the hundred-first fork in the road.

At that moment, you might laugh—not because you have learned something, but because you are still asking that question.

After laughing, you might still remember that little symbol—≟(fit)—remembering that it is not an answer, merely a reminder.

A reminder: the question is yours to ask, the ruler yours to choose, the road yours to walk.

Ha ha ha ha.

This laugh rings louder than any proof.
